        <h2>Approach/Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                When approaching the project, I went in with the idea of making my very first portfolio and very first website at the same time, so I wasn’t expecting perfection as I can iterate over time and fix anything needed. 
                This would be my base framework to add onto later. First steps were to make a timeline which I followed well as I stayed up to pace. 
                I made the barebones html and separated each with their own ids to make the CSS implementation go smoother. 
                For the CSS I thought what would make the website appealing to the eye as well as functional and doable, so I followed an idea in my head and went from there. 
                The JavaScript part was a little tricky as I wasn’t sure what I could really implement and use for my portfolio. I ended up making a button that would act as a theme switch by creating a second stylesheet and swapping the stylesheet on the button press. 
                Along with the button press I made a logo that would change depending on the theme being applied. After everything seemed finished, I moved onto this report.html.

        <h2>Evaluation/Discussion</h2>
            <p>
                I am proud about what I was able to accomplish as I was unsure of my ability to making the website from scratch, 
                but as I dumped more hours into it, I began to start enjoying the process and making slight changes along the way, until it began to feel like one cohesive piece.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Looking back at the project I know I can add more to it to have a fully functioning portfolio, and by doing this project I now have a concrete basis to build upon, along with much more motivation to complete it.

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>
                For future work I would like to make it so when I switch stylesheets, the next html loaded uses the stylesheet that the last html had selected. 
                I was unable to do this within the time frame, but I think with some tinkering it may very well be possible.
                I also was trying to swap the icon from red to blue depending on the button press, but I had no luck when trying to implement the JavaScript. I think this is due to the page needing to be reloaded to display the new icon.
