        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the website about?</li>
        <p>
            The website I am currently making will be a sort of portfolio for myself as I have yet to make one.
        </p>
        <li>What is it’s purpose (can be more than one)?</li>
        <p>
            The purpose is to improve my knowledge and execution of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, along with creating a basis of my portfolio that I can later down the line, change if needed.
        </p>
        <li>Who is the target audience?</li>
        <p>
            The target audience will be my peers in class, along with possible employers looking into projects I have completed along with some basic information about myself.
        </p>
        <li>What does the target audience want from the website?</li>
        <p>
            The target audience wants to learn more about me and what I do.
        </p>

        <h2>Competitive Research</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are there other websites on your topic?</li>
        <p>
            Other websites have portfolios, but none have been made of me.
        </p>
        <li>What are other sites doing? What are they successful at? What are they unsuccessful at?</li>
        <p>
            Other portfolio websites are made to benefit the individuals they are about. They are successful when the styling is well thought out and appealing to the eye. They are unsuccessful if they fail to keep the reader interested, and engaged with the information being presented.
        </p>
        <li>How can your site be better or different than the competitors?</li>
        <p>
            My site can be better and or different from other portfolios, as I may have experince in subjects others do not.
